# ExtractingImagesAndPosting
The First Project That I did on Java.

ExtractingImages.java is the code used to save the type of images that you want on Unsplash and 
saving them onto a file in the same directory as your package. 
First, you establish a connection with the unsplash api.
If the connection is successful, we begin to read the contents of the JSON Array.
Next, we extract the links that we want to download and put them onto an array called links.
Once that is done, we create a new file called input(j).jpg and save them onto the director as a jpg file.
