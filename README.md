# ExtractingImagesAndPosting
The First Project That I did on Java.

ExtractingImages.java is the code used to save the type of images that you want on Unsplash and 
saving them onto a file in the same directory as your package. 
\
\
First, you establish a connection with the unsplash api.
\
\
If the connection is successful, we begin to read the contents of the JSON Array and converting them into string called responsebody.
\
\
Next, we extract the links that we want to download and put them onto an array called links.
\
\
Once that is done, we create a new file called input(j).jpg and save them onto the director as a jpg file.
